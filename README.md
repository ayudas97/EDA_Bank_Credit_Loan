-  CSV file containing the raw data.
-  Brief Summary of the project in the powerpoint.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis includes the following steps:

1. Data Loading: Loading the dataset into Python environment.
2. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing the distribution of variables, identifying correlations, and visualizing patterns in the data.
4. Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the model's performance.
5. Insights and Conclusion: Summarizing the findings and drawing conclusions from the analysis.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are used for this analysis:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these dependencies using pip:
